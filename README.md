## Overview

**Virtual javascript worlds at planetary scales.**

> **Warning**
> These libraries are a work in progress. APIs may change unexpectedly until they reach version 1.0.

In this project you'll find a growing collection of tools to plop large planets into your [`three.js`](threejs.org/) scene, and then populate that world with interesting things.
