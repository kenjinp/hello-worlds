## Overview

**Virtual javascript worlds at planetary scales.**

> **Warning**
> These libraries are a work in progress. APIs may change unexpectedly until they reach version 1.0.

In this project you'll find a growing collection of tools to plop large planets into your [`three.js`](threejs.org/) scene, and then populate that world with interesting things.

If you're interested in using this library and want to keep up to date, please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KennyPirman), and/or click the Watch button for this repository.
