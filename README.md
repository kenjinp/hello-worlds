## Overview

**CPU-based terrain generation for three.js or react three fiber**

> **Warning**
> These libraries are a work in progress. APIs may change unexpectedly until they reach version 1.0.

In this project you'll find a growing collection of tools to plop large planets into your [`three.js`](threejs.org/) scene, and then populate that world with interesting things.

If you're interested in using this library and want to keep up to date, please [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/KennyPirman), and/or click the Watch button for this repository.

## Alternatives 💕

There are a couple solutions allow you to create beautiful terrain using web technologies:

- [PlanetTechJS](hhttps://github.com/miguelmyers8/PlanetTechJS) - "What sets this library apart is its utilization of the GPU for all tasks. This includes generating textures for each facet, performing displacement, and shaping PlaneGeometries into spherical forms; the entire process occurs on the GPU. Consequently, there is no need for WebWorkers at this stage."

- [terra](https://github.com/fintelia/terra) - rust-based renderer of offline-generated heightmaps

- [three-landscape](https://github.com/nwpointer/three-landscape) - beautiful terrain material
