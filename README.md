# Hello Worlds üëãüåê

Your Virtual Worldbuilding toolkit for the web.

Within you'll find a growing collection of tools to plop large planets into your [`three.js`](threejs.org/) scene, and then populate that world with societies and languages.

## Roadmap

This project is large enough in scope to last several lifetimes. Here are a couple of the next tasks on my mind.
Probably not in order.

- [x] Readable Documentation Portal
- [ ] Codesandbox examples (Hello World, Planet, Moon)
- [ ] API docs
- [ ] Make Webworkers optional
- [ ] Enable use in node.js (remove webworker dependency)
- [ ] Lifecycle events
- [ ] Point-specific height generation example (Moon Craters)
- [ ] Character-on-surface playable example
- [ ] Calculate Long & Lat
- [ ] Great Arc helper & methods
- [ ] Bezier Curves over a sphere (for labels and such)
- [ ] Oceans example and helpers
- [ ] Simple Atmosphere helpers
- [ ] Voronoi subdivision of sphere for... science...
