# Moon

Moons, also known as natural satellites, are celestial bodies that orbit around planets. They are usually much smaller than the planet they orbit and are made up of rock and other solid materials. Moons are typically formed when a celestial body, such as an asteroid or comet, collides with a planet and the debris from the collision becomes caught in the planet's gravitational field. This debris then coalesces into a moon. Moons can have a variety of surface features, including craters, mountains, and valleys, and they can also have their own satellites, or moons of moons. The gravitational interactions between a moon and its planet can also cause tidal forces, which can affect the planet's oceans and weather patterns.
