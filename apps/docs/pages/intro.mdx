## Write Javascript, create huge worlds!

So you've watched a few videos about procedurally generating planets. Or you've played StarCitizen, and now it's time to implement `StarCitizen.js`. Why not? The browser is a perfect place for large virtual worlds, and game development with javascript or React is both fun and practical. Your rad mmorpg deserves a vast setting to play in. So let's create a world!

`hello-worlds` is a collection of libraries that helps you procedurally generate beautiful, fantastic worlds, and populate them with interesting stuff.

Using these libraries, you can create three.js planetoids, moons, earth-sized celestial objects, and eventually more fantastic realms like ring-worlds, donut-earths, inverted dyson-sphere-like worlds, or maybe a disc world. The point is not to be realistic (although you can be), but _fantastic_!

I've created these packages and docs as a way to organize my (limited) knowledge about procedural generation. It might not be useful for your website or game, but you you might be able to learn something from [reading the source](https://github.com/kenjinp/hello-worlds).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  I'm changing things up in this library on a _daily_ basis. Expect these docs
  to be outdated as soon as they are available online! If you need help or want
  to ask questions, [reach out on twitter](https://twitter.com/KennyPirman) or

## Libraries in hello-worlds

### [`hello-worlds/planets`](/libraries/planets)

Create planets and other various types of worlds in `three.js`.

### [`hello-worlds/react`](/libraries/react)

Create `hello-worlds` planets and worlds in your `@react-three/fiber` scene via `React`.

### [`hello-worlds/tongues`](/libraries/tongues)

Generate a plausible-ish randomly generated language.

### [`hello-worlds/cultures`](/libraries/cultures)

Procedurally generate countries, their languages, and their demographics. Based on "Medieval Demographics Made Easy" by S. John Ross and popularized by [dunjon.bin.sh](https://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/demographics/)

### [`hello-worlds/core`](/libraries/core)

Core library that each depends on. Mostly useful for setting global `seeds`.
