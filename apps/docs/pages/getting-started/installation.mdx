# Installation

`hello-worlds` is essentially a set of npm packages. If you're familiar with js, you'll be right at home.

## Requirements

We make use of web-workers (for now). Therefore you'll require a bundler, such as `webpack` or `vite`, or `esbuild`. More on this in the next section.

## Packages

You'll need `three.js` installed, as it is a peer dependency. If you plan to use the `@react-three/fiber` react library, you'll also want to install `@hello-worlds/react`

`hello-worlds` is typed out-of-the-box for typescript users.
