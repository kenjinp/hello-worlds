# Roadmap

The following represents an overview of Hello-World's roadmap. It's going to be a long way to v1, where the API will stabilize, so please consider contributing or offering your input to help pave the way!

These are the topics I consider important for a v1 release:

- **Isomorphic terrain generation** - allow worlds to be created server-side (for the purposes of multiplayer, for example)
- **Floating Origin support**
- **Improvements in pooling resources** for multiple worlds rendered in the same scene
- **Terrain Scattering Examples**
- **More functional & chainable generators**
- **Better terrain stitching to remove seams**

Check out the [roadmap on GitHub](https://github.com/users/kenjinp/projects/2) to get informed about what is being worked on, and what will come later.
