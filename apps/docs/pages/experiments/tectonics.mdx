# Plate Tectonics

Combining various techniques it's possible to generate a beleiveable (more or less) geology for your world.

  This will take a long time to load, and is in active development. This is in a
  kind of a crazy experimental stage :)

## Features

Using a simple model of plate tectonics, we can simulate a snapshot of the Planet's
surface. This will provide us a number of terrain features that we can use to create a more beleiveable world, such as:

- volanic island chains
- rift vallies
- mountain ranges

Expanding on the cellular approach, we could even assign temperature, climates, biomes, and polities. Isn't that cool? Yes! Yes it is!

## Method

We'll chop the world into cells using voronoi.

1. Createa a "jittered" array of points around the surface of the Planet.
2. Create a Voronoi diagram from the points.
3. Create a list of defined Plates
4. Assign each Voronoi cell to a Plate using a floodfill algorithm
5. Assign each voronoi cell edge a value that represents the violence that occurs when
   the plates collide.
6. Assign each voronoi cell a value that represents the elevation of the cell.
7. Pass the voronoi data to the heigh generator to assign the elevations to each vertex.
