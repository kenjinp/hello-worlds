# Noise

This library includes a couple of styles of noise to help generate interesting landscapes. The noise is based on a 3D simplex noise function.

The styles are based on [this excellent blog series by Giliam de Carpentier](https://www.decarpentier.nl/scape-procedural-basics).

More discussion about how to use noise in combinations will be covered in the [ProcGen Terrain Cookbook](/docs/category/procgen-terrain-cookbook).

## Usage

```typescript
import { Noise, NOISE_TYPES } from "@hello-worlds/planets"

new Noise({
  octaves: 13,
  persistence: 0.707,
  lacunarity: 1.8,
  exponentiation: 4.5,
  height: 300.0,
  scale: 1100.0,
  seed: "My Noise Seed",
  noiseType: NOISE_TYPES.FBM,
})

const { x, y, z } = new Vector3()

const value = Noise.get(x, y, z)
// returns some number
```

### Props

:::note Defaults
The props are all optional. The defaults may not make sense for your usecase.

|  persistence   | number             | 0.707                                 | A multiplier that determines how quickly the amplitudes diminish for each successive octave. |
|   lacunarity   | number             | 1.8                                   | the frequency multiplier between octaves                                                     |
| exponentiation | number             | 4.5                                   | Raises the output by this exponent, conveninece tool                                         |

## Noise Types

### Fractal Brownian Motion

The most generic and useful noise type.

### Billowing

Create bubbling landscapes reminiscent of sand dunes.

### Rigid

Create sharp peaks evoking mountainscapes.
